# ITI Final Project â€“ Recipe App (Laravel Blade & API)

This project was developed as part of the final assessment for the ITI program.
It is a complete recipe management system designed for a chef to manage and share his unique recipes with users through both a web dashboard and a public API.

---

## Project Overview

The system is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Admin Dashboard (Laravel Blade)

A web-based control panel that allows the chef or admin to:

* Add new recipes
* View all recipes
* Edit existing recipes
* Delete recipes
* Login securely to the dashboard

### 2. Public API (Laravel API)

A RESTful API designed to support mobile application integration. The API allows mobile users to:

* View all available recipes
* Add recipes to their favorites
* View their list of favorite recipes
* Remove recipes from favorites

Users are identified using a `device_id`, which removes the need for account creation or login in the mobile app.
